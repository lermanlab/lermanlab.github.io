The “Residual Tumor and Response to Treatment Laboratory” has four main goals.

**Identification of clinical and pathological factors correlated with the long-term prognosis of TNBC and HER2 positive breast cancer patients treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy.**

We have built a retrospective clinical, pathological and radiological database
of breast cancer patients treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy at Institut
Curie since 2002. In triple-negative breast carcinoma (TNBC) we have
highlighted a strong association between the lymph node involvement after
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and a poor prognosis outcome. We concluded
that clinical trials should be implemented for high-risk patients after NAC
(pN+, Elston Ellis Grade 3 and non menopausal status) to validate new
therapeutic solutions.
