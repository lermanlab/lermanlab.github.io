**This is the homepage for SEA lab at <a target="blank" href="https://www.isi.edu/">USC-Information Sciences Institute</a>, led by Prof. <a target="blank" href="https://www.isi.edu/people-lerman/">Kristina Lerman</a>. We are also affiliated with the  <a target="blank" href="https://www.cs.usc.edu/">Deptartment of Computer Science, USC Viterbi School of Engineering</a>.**

Lerman’s research aims to harness the power of AI in a connected world. Her past work has helped shape how we think about social media platforms, elucidating the role of social networks in the spread of information and also what we see and what we know. Her current research examines digital vulnerabilities in a hyperconnected world, including online influence campaigns, mental health harms and affective polarization. Lerman’s second major research area focuses  on how AI systems can learn from biased data. Her group is developing statistical methods to audit biases in real-world data and create fair models from biased data. These models will, in turn, enable socially-embedded AI systems to mediate human interactions to reduce antisocial behaviors and mitigate their unintended harms.
