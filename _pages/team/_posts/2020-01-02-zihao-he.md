I'm a final-year PhD candidate in computer science at University of Southern California (USC), where I work at the Information Sciences Institute. I am advised by Prof. Kristina Lerman. I am interested in the intersection of natural language processing and computational social science. Recently, I'm focused on evaluating the societal impacts of large language models (LLMs) and their alignment with different demographic groups.

Previously, I received undergraduate degree in Communication Engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. I've spent time at Tsinghua University working with Shutao Xia. During my PhD, I've interned at TikTok, Amazon, and DiDi Global.
