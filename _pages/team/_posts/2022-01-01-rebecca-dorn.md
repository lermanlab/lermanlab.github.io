Hello! I'm a third year PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Southern California's Information Science Institute. I am co-advised by Professors Kristina Lerman and Fred Morstatter. I study how historic systems of inequity are embedded into AI pipelines. Lately, I have been focusing on biases against Transgender and Non-Binary individuals in Natural Language Processing systems.

Prior to USC, I worked with Families USA to increase health insurance subsidies in the 2021 American Rescue Plan. I also served as Educational Director at Habonim Dror Camp Moshava. I earned a BS in Computer Science from the University of California, Santa Cruz, where I helped Professor Lise Getoor create the school's first Ethics & AI computer science course. Have a look at my academic CV and Google Scholar profile.
