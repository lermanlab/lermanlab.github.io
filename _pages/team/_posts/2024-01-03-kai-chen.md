I am a second-year PhD student at University of Southern California(USC), where I work at the Information Sciences Institute (USC-ISI). I am advised by Prof Kristina Lerman. My research interest mainly revolves around computational social science and natural language processing. Specifically, I am interested in safety and alignment of large language models (LLMs). Recently, I have been studying ideological manipulation in LLMs. I also use LLM to understand the influence campaign in online social media.
